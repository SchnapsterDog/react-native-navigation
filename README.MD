React Native brings [**React**'s][r] declarative UI framework to iOS and Android. With React Native, you use native UI controls and have full access to the native platform.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

React Native apps may target iOS 11.0 and Android 5.0 (API 21) or newer. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. Tools like [Expo](https://expo.io) can be used to work around this.

## ðŸŽ‰ Installation

- Clone the project
- npm install 
- npm start

## ðŸ“„ License

React Native is MIT licensed, as found in the [LICENSE][l] file.
